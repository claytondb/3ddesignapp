# 3D Design App

Cross-platform scan-to-CAD software for reverse engineering.

## Overview

Convert 3D scan meshes (STL/OBJ/PLY) into editable CAD models (STEP/IGES). Inspired by Revo Design / QuickSurface.

## Features (Planned)

- **Mesh Import & Editing** — Load, simplify, repair scan data
- **Primitive Extraction** — Fit planes, cylinders, cones, spheres
- **2D/3D Sketching** — Draw on sections and mesh surfaces
- **Surface Fitting** — Create NURBS surfaces from mesh
- **CAD Export** — STEP and IGES output

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++ / Python
- **UI:** Qt 6
- **3D Engine:** OpenGL
- **Geometry:** Open CASCADE (OCCT)
- **Mesh:** libigl, CGAL

## Status

🚧 **In Development**
